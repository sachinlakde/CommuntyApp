How To Create A Lightning Web Component?
Stepwise Procedure :
Step 1: Create a Project, In the command prompt enter >sfdx, it will show the options to create, select >SFDX:Create Project
Step 2: Select Standard Project Template
Step 3: After that enter your project name
Step 4: Now, you have created your project, but you need to Authorize the org, which means, whatever task you are performing, 
         you need to reflect that on your Salesforce org, for this you need to connect visual studio code to your Salesforce org. 
Step 5: After you have Authorized your org, you need to go to once again open command prompt and enter create lightning web component, select this and your LWC is created.

Step 6:  In your LWC component .html file

Enter the following code:
<template>
   <lightning-card title="First LWC" >
     <div>
       <p>This is my, {EnterPhrase}!</p>
       <lightning-input label="Name" value={greeting} onchange={changeHandler}></lightning-input>
     </div>
   </lightning-card>
 </template>
 
 In your .js File enter the following code:
 import { LightningElement } from 'lwc';
export default class First_LWC extends LightningElement {
    EnterPhrase = 'First LWC';
    changeHandler(event) {
        this.greeting = event.target.value;
    }
}

And at last, in .xml file

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<LightningComponentBundle xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata" >
   <apiVersion>50.0</apiVersion>
   <isExposed>true</isExposed> <!-- true, so that LWC can be visible-->
   <targets>
       <target>lightning__AppPage</target>
       <target>lightning__RecordPage</target>
       <target>lightning__HomePage</target>
     </targets>
</LightningComponentBundle>

Step7:After this, once again send the changes to your org, but this time you need to deploy this component to the Salesforce org.

Step8: Now, to test how your LWC works, if you do not wish to add this on your org UI and simply want to test it, 
               then go to your developer Console and create a Lightning Application.
               
Step9:Enter the following and click on preview.
<aura:application extends="force:slds">
    <c:first_LWC/>
</aura:application>
